Pipulate lets you collect data straight off of the Web into spreadsheets

Got a list that you need to look up something for eveyr item - like grabbing
litle tags for a list of URLs? Well, then Pipulate is your answer! For example,
for any given URL. you will be able to:
    
    1. Record the number of times that URL has appeared in a Tweet
    2. Record the number of times that URL was liked or shared in Facebook
    3. Record the number if times that URL was +1'd in Google Plus
    4. Figure out what keyword the page is trying to target for search traffic
    5. See how well that URL is doing for that keyword (position tracking)

And it all accumulates on a spreadsheet where you can do trending and keep track
of progress - all for free! But Pipulate is so much more, able to do such
lookups using any source data (addresseds, keywords, etc.) against any Web or data API
source (you have access to), allowing you to write your own Python functions to extend
system. And what system is that? You can learn it well, because almost every line of code
accompanied by a Youtube video.
